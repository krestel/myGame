## Ideas for future versions

- use a customized progress bar a-la http://www.minddust.com/project/bootstrap-progressbar/
- animate boxes as they come into view
- use images (svg, png) instead of words
- save a users progress in the browser
- have small boxes at the bottom which show which question the user is on and which questions they have gotten right or wrong
- a circular countdown timer instead of using the progress bar a-la http://www.jqueryscript.net/loading/Create-Percentage-Circles-with-jQuery-CSS3-percircle-js.html
